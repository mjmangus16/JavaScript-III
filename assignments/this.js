/* The for principles of "this";
 * in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
 *
 * 1. Global Scope: When 'this' is not bound to anything and references the window or global scope.
 * 2. Implicit Binding: When you use 'this' inside of a function that is part of an object, 'this' references the object.
 * 3. New Binding: When you create a constructor function, 'this' refers to an instance of that constructor function.
 * 4. Explicit Binding: When you use the call or apply method to directly bind this to an object
 *
 * write out a code example of each explanation above
